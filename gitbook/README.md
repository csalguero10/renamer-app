# What is Preservia?

**Preservia App** is the first version of a web application designed to manage the metadata workflow for heritage documents, aimed at archivists and librarians. It supports features such as upload and automatic classification (using heuristics and OCR), bulk validation and editing, flexible numbering with support for Arabic/Roman numerals, extras, and ghost numbers, as well as intelligent file renaming and an export function that creates a ZIP file with the renamed images and a `metadata.json` file.
