# Preservia App

The app is designed to **organize, enrich, and streamline the management of digitized images of books, catalogs, manuscripts, and archival collections**. While professional photo editors such as _Adobe Lightroom_ or _Capture One_ are widely used for color correction, aesthetic editing, and photographic cataloging, they **do not address the specific needs of librarians, archivists, and cultural heritage researchers**.

The app fills this gap by providing an intuitive **workflow tailored to bibliographic and archival materials**, where the focus is not only on the photograph as an image, but on the **document’s structure and descriptive context**.

### **Key Features**

1. **Batch upload and automatic classification**
   * Supports uploading entire sets of digitized images.
   * Automatically identifies common page types (cover, back cover, illustration, blank page, etc.).
   * Assigns initial metadata to each file to accelerate cataloging.
2. **Metadata editing (batch or individual)**
   * Enables corrections or additions for each page: pagination (Arabic or Roman), additional notes (bis, a, v…), ghost pages, or validation status.
   * Allows batch editing for multiple images at once.
3. **Flexible visualization modes**
   * **Gallery:** fast browsing via thumbnails with direct selection (inspired by desktop file explorers).
   * **List:** detailed view with filters by status or page type.
   * **Viewer:** full-screen navigation with dynamic zoom, pan, and immediate editing.
4. **Structured export**
   * Automatically generates a `metadata.json` file with normalized information for all images.
   * Packages renamed and coherent files into a ZIP for preservation, sharing, or integration into digital repositories.
5. **Tools adapted to real workflows**
   * Multi-selection with clicks, ranges, or keyboard shortcuts.
   * Automatic page numbering for filtered sets.
   * Visual indicators (blue border on selected items, quick validation)
