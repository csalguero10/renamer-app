# What is Preservia?

**Preservia App** is the first version of a web application designed to manage the metadata workflow for heritage documents, aimed at archivists and librarians. It supports features such as upload and automatic classification (using heuristics and OCR), bulk validation and editing, flexible numbering with support for Arabic/Roman numerals, extras, and ghost numbers, as well as intelligent file renaming and an export function that creates a ZIP file with the renamed images and a `metadata.json` file.

### Learning Path

To develop the app, I first created a very limited and rough version using Python for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend, a framework that allows building simple applications without the need to set up APIs or complex configurations. After realizing how limited this approach was, I decided to move to **Svelte**, a more complete and complex framework that I am currently learning. Because of this, I had to rely heavily on artificial intelligence tools (ChatGPT and Gemini) to guide me and ensure the application was programmed correctly.
