# Key Features

**Batch upload and automatic classification**

* Supports uploading entire sets of digitized images.
* Automatically identifies common page types (cover, back cover, illustration, blank page, etc.).
* Assigns initial metadata to each file to accelerate cataloging.

**Metadata editing (batch or individual)**

* Enables corrections or additions for each page: pagination (Arabic or Roman), additional notes (bis, a, vâ€¦), ghost pages, or validation status.
* Allows batch editing for multiple images at once.
* Supports manual enrichment of metadata fields, enabling the addition of custom tags and keywords that later facilitate advanced multimedia information retrieval.

**Flexible visualization modes**

* **Gallery**: fast browsing via thumbnails with direct click selection (inspired by desktop file explorers).
* **List**: detailed view with filters by status or page type.
* **Viewer**: full-screen navigation with dynamic zoom, pan, and immediate editing.

**Structured export**

* Produces a unified `metadata.json` file that consolidates both catalog-level descriptive metadata (originally provided in Excel) and page-level metadata.
* Packages renamed, coherent files into a ZIP for preservation, sharing, or integration into digital repositories.
* Prepares the data for building relational models and further automated processing.

**Tools adapted to real workflows**

* Multi-selection via click, ranges, or keyboard shortcuts.
* Automatic page numbering for filtered sets.
* Visual indicators (e.g., blue border on selected items, quick validation).
