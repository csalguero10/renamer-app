# Why is this app important for booksellers and archivists?

While it may seem redundant, renaming the image files of a digitized manuscript with descriptive names like "cover," "blank\_page," or "text" is a fundamental practice for librarians and archivists. This is done for critical reasons of preservation, accessibility, and functionality, even when the same information is detailed in the metadata.

The primary reason is that metadata and filenames serve distinct yet complementary roles.

**Metadata vs. Filenames**

* Metadata: This is the complete, structured information about a digital resource. It includes details such as the author, date, place of origin, dimensions, copyrights, and, of course, the content type of each page. Metadata is essential for searching, cataloging, and long-term management within a specific system or repository (like a digital library). However, this information is not always visible or accessible outside of that system.
* Filenames: These are the most basic and universal identification labels for a file. Their main function is to ensure each file is unique and that the entire set maintains a logical and coherent order.

**Why Renaming Files is Crucial**

Here are the key reasons why this practice is followed:

1\. Long-Term Preservation and Integrity üìÅ Metadata can become corrupted, lost, or separated from its corresponding files if they are moved from one system to another or if the management software becomes obsolete. In contrast, a filename is an intrinsic characteristic of the file itself. A descriptive filename (e.g., `Manuscript_X_001_cover.tiff`) ensures that the most basic information about the image's sequence and content persists, regardless of the software or environment. It acts as an "insurance policy" for essential information.

2\. Ease of Use and Human Readability üëÄ When a researcher, technician, or archivist downloads a set of images, descriptive filenames allow them to understand the manuscript's structure at a glance without needing to consult a separate database or metadata file. It is far more intuitive to work with a folder containing files named `001_cover`, `002_blank_page`, `003_text_start` than with generic names like `IMG_5032`, `IMG_5033`, `IMG_5034`.

3\. Maintaining Sequential Order üî¢ Manuscripts are sequential objects. Using a logical naming system (typically with leading zeros, like `001`, `002`, `003`...`112`) guarantees that files will sort correctly in any operating system. Adding a descriptive token like "cover" or "inside\_back\_cover" reinforces this sequence and helps to quickly identify key parts of the document.

4\. Interoperability Between Systems ‚öôÔ∏è When moving files between different platforms, hard drives, or sharing them with other institutions, there is no guarantee that the new system will be able to read or correctly interpret the original system's metadata. A well-structured filename, however, is universal and ensures that fundamental information always travels with the file.

**Limitations of Conventional Tools and Specific Needs**

Conventional photo editors like Lightroom or Capture One can add technical or photographic cataloging metadata (such as author, copyright, keywords), but they do not capture the bibliographic and documentary details essential for archival and book collections:

* Archivists need images to reflect the original document structure, including pagination, sections, and insertions. The filename is often the first line of defense in preserving this structural context.
* Booksellers require material to be systematically renamed and organized for reference, sales, or inclusion in digital catalogs, where a clear sequence and identification are paramount.
* Researchers rely on metadata that extends beyond the image itself. They need to know what type of page it is‚Äîa frontispiece, endpaper, insert, or plate. While this is metadata, having it reflected in the filename provides immediate context during analysis.

In summary, it is not a question of "metadata versus filenames," but rather of using both intelligently. The metadata holds the rich descriptive and technical detail, while the filename guarantees the persistence of the most essential information for identification, order, and comprehension over time.

This approach turns digitization into a complete workflow, ensuring that images are not only high-quality but are also accompanied by structured data prepared for long-term preservation, interoperability (such as with RDF and Linked Open Data), and rigorous scholarly use.
