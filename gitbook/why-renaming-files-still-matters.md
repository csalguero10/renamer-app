# Why Renaming Files Still Matters

Although it may seem redundant, renaming the image files of a digitized manuscript with descriptive names such as _“cover”_, _“blank\_page”_, or _“text”_ is a fundamental practice for librarians and archivists. This is not only for preservation but also for accessibility and usability, even when the same information is already recorded in the metadata.

**The key point is that metadata and file names serve different yet complementary functions.**

**Metadata vs. File Names**

* **Metadata**: Provide complete, structured information about a digital resource. They include details such as author, date, place of origin, dimensions, copyright, and the type of content of each page. Metadata are essential for search, cataloging, and long-term management within a specific system or digital library. However, this information is not always visible or accessible outside the system that manages it.
* **File names**: Represent the most basic and universal identification label of a file. Their primary role is to ensure uniqueness and maintain a logical, coherent order within a collection.

**Why File Renaming Matters**

1. **Preservation and Long-Term Integrity**\
   Metadata can become corrupted, lost, or disconnected from files when they are transferred between systems or if the original management software becomes obsolete. By contrast, the file name is intrinsic to the file itself. A descriptive name (e.g., _Manuscript\_X\_001\_cover.tiff_) ensures that essential information about sequence and content persists independently of software or environment. It acts as an “insurance policy” for the most basic yet vital information.
2. **Human Readability and Ease of Use**\
   When a researcher, technician, or archivist downloads a set of images, descriptive names allow them to understand the manuscript’s structure at a glance—without consulting a database or metadata file. Working with a folder named _001\_cover, 002\_blank\_page, 003\_text\_start_ is far more intuitive than deciphering a sequence like _IMG\_5032, IMG\_5033, IMG\_5034_.
3. **Maintaining Sequential Order**\
   Manuscripts are inherently sequential objects. Using a logical naming system (often with leading zeros, such as _001, 002, 003…112_) guarantees that files display in the correct order across any operating system. Adding descriptors such as _cover_ or _inner\_back\_cover_ further reinforces the sequence and helps quickly identify key parts of the document.
4. **System Interoperability**\
   When files are moved across platforms, drives, or shared with other institutions, there is no guarantee that the new system will correctly interpret the original metadata. A well-structured file name, however, is universal and ensures that the core information always travels with the file.
